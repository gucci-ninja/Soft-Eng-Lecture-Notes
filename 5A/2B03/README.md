  - 2005 new KBO bigger than Pluto
    - Pluto no longer a planet
  - This object with several other objects as big as Pluto are called dwarf planets
- To find KBO, we take photos over a time frame and the distance travelled over the timeframe will show what it is
  - fast: asteroid
  - medium: KBO
  - slow: star
  - unmoving: galaxy?
- Definition:
  - is in orbit around the Sun
  - is close to round in shape
    - big enough objects in space will be round due to gravity
  - intersect with other dwarf planet/planet orbits.
    - has not "cleared the neighborhood"
  - is not a satellite
- small solar object: non-round objects orbitting the sun

### Interstellar space

- a million times larger than interplanetary space
- a million times smaller than intergalactic space

## Lecture 5

### interstellar space

- space between stars
  - usually thin gaseous material
  - giant interstellar gas clouds collapse due to gravity and becomes a star
- best way measure distance of nearby star: parallax star
  - in 6 month difference, see how much a star moves relative to background stars
  - closer the star, the bigger the movement of the star.
  - done since the 1800
  - easier for bigger orbits
- parsec or lightyear is used to measure far objects
  - parsec is around 3.3 lightyears
  - 1.3 parsec is around 4 lightyears (closest star)
- milky way has two satallite galaxies
- gaia space mission measures 1.7 billion stars

### intergalactic space

- million times larger than interstellar distances
- use Megaparsecs (million parsec) => millions of lightyears
- spiral galaxy
  - typical spiral galaxy has around 100 billion stars
    - has arms coming from the center
    - many new stars form along the arms
  - shaped like a frisbee, rotating
  - can be tens of thousands of lightyears across
  - density of stars decrease as we go closer to the edge
  - face on vs edge on are different angles to view galaxies
  - center has a bulge, flat at the edge
- eliptical galaxy
  - a lot less structure
    - bright center and fade towards the edge
  - not a disc like spiral galaxy
  - swarm of bees
  - very little gas
- galaxy zoo
  - crowdsource galaxy names

### galaxy collections

- galaxy groups: at least 3 galaxies affected by one another
- compact galaxy group
  - distances between galaxies are within each other's edge
- galaxy clusters: thousands of member galaxies
  - largest galaxies in the universe usually center of galaxy clusters
    - 1 trillion stars
  - clusters have different context when used to describe galaxy clusters vs star clusters

### Lookback Time

- light requires time to travel
- if light from far away travels to us, it takes longer than if the source was close by
- we are therefore always looking at the object in the past.
- used in galaxy evolution field.

## Lecture 6

### simulation

- how galaxys interact with nearby galaxies
  - giant gravity throws stars
  - colours change over time
    - blue: newer stars formations
    - red: merged galaxies
  - spiral galaxies merge to become eliptical galaxy

### cosmology

- study of origin and evolution of universe
- discovered in 1930 galaxies are getting farther away
  - implies universe is expanding (exponentially)
- distance to galaxies
  - can't use parallax
  - we compare with conventional knowledge (standard candle effect)
    - some objects has the same brightness always (supernova)
    - we take the amount of light coming from these objects to see how far they are
    - not precise and too slow
  - velocity of galaxy (Doppler shift)
    - light waves will stretch and squish as galaxies move
    - galaxies moving away shifts towards infrared (**redshift**)
    - galaxies moving towards shifts towards ultraviolet (**blueshift**)
    - to find if the lights are shifting
      - we find the spectrum lines of the elements making up the object giving off the light
      - if the spectrum lines are slightly more red or blue, it has shifted
    - every galaxy has a unique spectrum line
    - can measure distance and speed very percisely
      - larger distance, the faster it is moving away
      - almost all galaxies are redshifted
    - discovered by Edwin Hubble
      - Hubble's Law
      - Hubble-Lemaitre Law
        - Speed is porportional to distance
        - V = (Hubble's constant) \* distance
        - **V = H \* d**

---

- Expanding Universe
  - rather than galaxies moving
  - space is expanding between galaxies
  - raisin bread analogy
    - distance between raisins gets larger when bread rises

## Lecture 7

- **Hubble-Lemaitre Law**
  - relation between motion of a galaxy and its distance from us:
    - Speed: measured from amount of Doppler shift
      - towards infrared: moving farther
      - towards ultraviolet: moving closer
    - Distance: measured with standard candle technique
      - fainter = further
  - further away, the faster the speed
  - V = H \* d
- galaxies are not moving, rather the universe is expanding, and the space between galaxies are expanding

### Hubble's Law

- overall appearance of the universe should be changing with time
  - long ago, they are closer together
  - we can see this by looking farther
    - the father the object, the longer it takes the light to reach us
- universe may have a beginning
  - v = H \* d
    - speed = constant \* distance
  - d = v \* 1/H
    - distance = speed \* time
    - 1/H is a time
      - is time since expansion began
      - around **13 billion years** (13.8)
      - assumes rate of expansion is constant
  - to check
    - is the expansion the same in all directions
      - yes
    - measure galaxies in many different directions and find that 1/H is around the same
- what is the universe spanding into
- if universe is finite, what is beyond the universe
- will we reach a time where space was just dark and empty

## Lecture 8

- 2 ways to collect data:
  1. Imaging=Pictures
  2. Spectroscopy=Spectrum

### Imaging

- take pictures in Red, Green, Blue and combine them
  - pictures are taken greyscale with rgb filter
    - shows how much red, green, blue exist
  - cam take photos beyond visible spectrum
  - computer adds colour and combines the 3 pictures
- pretty

### Spectroscopy

- measure how much light at every wavelength
- specific wavelengths have extra light
  - plot in a graph
- can find out what objects in universe are made of

### Atmospheric Opacity

- astronomers can't view everything from the surface on the earth
- many times, we need to send telescopes into space
- Ultraviolet and shorter is blocked
- visible light is visible with little distortion
- visible spectrum is absorbed
- radiowave is observable
- longer wavelength is blocked
- Sound is not a electromagnetic radiation
  - it is a pressure wave
  - cannot travel through space

## Lecture 9

### Basic Physics

#### Space and distance

- meter (m)

| object                | size (~m)            |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| you                   | 2                    |
| distance to the sun   | 10<sup>11</sup>      |
| to the nearest galaxy | 2 \* 10<sup>22</sup> |
| size of atom          | 10<sup>-10</sup>     |

- 1960 the meter was defined in context of atomic physics
  - certain colour wavelengths from krypton (kr) isotope

#### Time

- second (s)

| object   | age (~s)             |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| you      | 6 \* 10<sup>8</sup>  |
| universe | 4 \* 10<sup>17</sup> |

- defined to be a certain number of vibrations of cesium atom (Cs)
  - standardized

#### Mass

- kilogram (kg)
- measure of "inertia"
  - the greater the mass, the greater
- defined in terms of Planck constant

#### Speed

- distance travelled over time it takes to get there
- meters per second (m/s)
- all electromagnetic radiation travels at the same speed (c)
  - ~300000000 m/s
  - the fastest anything in the universe can travel at
- distance travelled can be calculated
  - d = v \* t
    - d = distance travelled
    - v = velocity
    - t = time
  - some distances are used frequently to be used as constants
    - light year: time it takes light to travel in a year
      - d = c \* t
      - d ~ 10<sup>16</sup>

#### Prefix

- can use prefix for different orders of magnitudes

### Fundamental Forces

#### Gravity

- attraction of one mass on another
- scales with mass and distance
- the balance of gravity and kinetic energy from the motions of stars are balanced in a galaxy to keep it from collapsing or dispersing
  - too little kinetic energy, the galaxy would collapse
  - too much kinetic energy, the galaxy would disperse into a new equilibrium
- strength of 10<sup>-38</sup>

#### Strong force

- holds atom nucli together
- very short range
- strength of 1
- strongest force

#### Electromagnetic force

- holds atoms together
- infinite range
- strength of 0.01

#### Weak force

- causes nuclear decay
- very short range
- strength of 0.00001

#### Gravitational force

- between two objects
- depends on
  - mass
  - distance between the objects _r_ (from the center of the object)
  - gravitational constant _G_
- _F_ = _G_ \* (_M<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2</sub>_)/_r<sup>2</sup>_

## Lecture 10

- 4 fundamental forces
  - strong force
    - short range
    - strength 1
  - electromagnetic force
    - infinite range
    - strength 0.01
  - weak force
    - very short range
    - 0.00001
  - gravity
    - infinite range
    - 10<sup>-38</sup>

### Why is gravity so much weaker

- much weaker than other forces
  - gravitational constant G is much smaller than other fundamental force constants
- Theory is we live in a **3+1 dimension**
  - we talk about
    - left and right
    - back and forth
    - up and down
  - 3 space dimensions (3D)
  - 1 temporal dimension (time)
  - allows us to uniqely define any event in the universe
    - where and when it occurs
  - maybe gravity is similar strength in other dimensions that we can't observe
  - quantum gravity
    - string theory

#### Weight

- force of gravity on an object
- mass is a constant

#### Balance of forces

- person sitting in a chair doesn't fall through
  - due to electromagnetic forces
  - electrons in body repel electrons in chair

#### 2013 Ig Nobel Physics

- Humans are physically capable of running across the surface of a pond if on the moon

#### Relativity (modern gravity)

- Relative motion
  - why does javelin thrower run with javelin
  - javelin speed is run speed + throw speed
  - javelin is faster relative to ground

## Lecture 11

- Javelin throwers run before they throw
  - javelin will be faster as its total speed is running speed + throwing speed

### Special Relativity

- 1905
  - Einstein published special theory of relativity
  - believed that light is same speed for every frame of reference
- example
  - two people
    - one is on earth
    - one is moving 1 000 000 m/s relative to first person
  - they see light moving towards them
    - what is the speed of the light
    - both are the **same**
- example
  - two rocket ships
    - both moving 1 000 000 m/s
    - one throws a teddy bear 250m/s
      - teddy bear is moving 1 000 250 m/s relative to stationary observer
    - one flashes light
      - light is moving at speed of light (no changes)
- nothing can move faster than speed of light
  - objects moving at the speed of light must have 0 mass
- every frame of reference measures speed of light as c
- nothing can move faster than speed of light
- anything with mass moves slower than c
- only massless objects can move at speed of light

#### Relativity of Simultaneity

- events which are simultaneous in one frame may not be in another
- each observer of the event is correct with their interpretation of the event
  - each observer is in their own frame of reference

#### Consequences of Special Relativity (time)

- 2 observers moving .99c relative to each other
  - their ideas of time and distance will be muddled.
- Time
  - time taken for light to travel to mirror and back from source
  - d = v \* t
  - t = d/c = 2\*x/c
    x = distance to mirror from source
  - if observer was moving relative to light
    - distance(d) travel will be farther
    - time taken(t) will be larger
  - moving clocks run slowly

## Lecture 12

### Time Dialation

- moving clocks run slowly
- Time = distance/speed of light
- Box with light bouncing between two mirrors
  - observing same frame of reference
    - light is traveling the length of the mirrors
  - observing in a different frame of reference
    - light is travelling a longer distance between mirrors
    - the faster the light is travelling from our frame of reference, the farther the light travels
      - the longer it takes for light to move.
- every frame of reference is still and other frames of reference is always moving relative to it.
- time is slower depending on speed v
  - slower by factor γ
  - γ = 1/(1-v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>
  - isn't significant (measurable) until v=0.5c

### Length Contraction

- objects seen in a different(moving) reference frames appear shorter along the direction of motion
- c = d/t
  - if time changes when viewing from different frames of reference, distance must as well
  - time increases
  - therefore distance decreases

### Consequences Special Relativity

- time dialation
- length contraction
- no absolute simultaneity
- all measurements are relative to observer
- Special Relativity in everyday life
  - GPS
  - particle accelerators
  - heavy elements
    - electrons of heavy elements are affected by relativity

### Einstein's famous equation

- E = mc<sup>2</sup>
- E: energy
- m: mass
- c: speed of light
- mass and energy is the same thing
- very hard to convert mass to energy
- moving mass is larger than still mass
  - m = γm<sub>0</sub>
  - m<sub>0</sub>: mass at rest
  - mass of an object would be infinite if it is moving at c

## Lecture 14

### 3D SpaceTime Diagram

- Light Cone represents light moving away from us or towards us

### Quantum World-Light

- what is light?
  - behaves as a wave
- speed: **c**
- frequency: **f**
  - same as pitch
  - Hz
  - how many times per second does wave repeat
    - number of wavelengths per second
- wavelength **λ**
  - distance before wave repeats itself
  - distance between tops/bottoms
- speed = frequency\*wavelength
  - speed is always constant
  - f bigger λ smaller
  - f smaller λ bigger
- in order of increasing frequency (and therefore energy)
  - radio
  - infrared
  - visible (red-violet)
  - ultraviolet
  - X ray
  - gamma rays
- running towards light
  - blueshift
  - more waves per unit time
  - higher frequency
- running away from light
  - redshift
  - less waves per unit time
  - lower frequency

#### Quantum Weirdness

- everyday experience doesn't prepare for what happens at high speeds (relativity)
- it also doesn't help us with very small objects (quantum mechanics)

### Quantum Physics

- Quantum Mechanics (1926)
  - Newton's laws break down when applied to distances comparable to the size of an atom
- 1899
  - attempting to understand "blackbody" radiation
  - hot objects glow with a spectrum of colours depending only on temperature, not chemical compositions
    - stars are really good blackbodies
  - hotter temperature is "bluer"
  - cooler temperature is "redder"
- 1900
  - Max Planck explained black body radiation
  - light came in small "chunks" or quanta
  - Nobel Prize for Physics 1918

## Lecture 15

- Normal (classical) physics
- if you want to knock something around, you need momentum
- momentum = mass \* speed
  - p=mv

### Light Particle

- Planck's ideas began the study of very small objects
- Einstein's Nobel Prize was for the photoelectric effect, not relativity
  - when light is shone on metal
  - electric current comes out of the metal
  - disagrees with current model of physics
    - light consists of particles
    - photons
- to knock out object, light needs mass
- but doesn't have any mass
- light has momentum but no mass
- photon is a particle of light
  - packet of energy
    - quanta
  - behaves like both waves and particle
    - duality
- energy of a photon depend of frequency
  - E = h f
  - h is Planck's constant
- receding stars therefore have less energetic light
  - red-shifted light = less frequency
- De Broglie guessed that some particles can act like waves.
  - associated with all particles is a wavelength
  - smaller the momentum, the longer tha wavelength
    - electrons are good to use for wavelength experiments

### Quantum Tunneling

- allows nuclear fusion
- Electronics (diodes, transistors, flash memory)
- given enough time
  - a particle can get past a "hill"/barrier
    - due to uncertainty principle + wave like property
- Scanning Tunneling Microscopes
  - measuring electronic properties at atomic scales

### Double Slit Experiment

- source eject quantum particle towards a wall
  - there are 2 slit in the wall
  - there is another wall that measures where the particle lands
- instead of two collections of electrons behind each slits (classical particle)
  - interference pattern shows up (waves)
  - where the electrons show up in a wave like pattern
- if you try to observe the electron as it goes through the slits, it changes the experiment
  - acts like a classical particle

## Lecture 16

### Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

- the best way to measure object positions is to bounce something off it
  - for very small objects, even light has momentum
  - when bouncing something off it, you move it
  - position would move
  - therefore we **cannot measure position and momentum precisely**
- Δx Δp > h/4π
  - x: position
  - p: momentum
  - Δ: uncertainty of
  - h: planck constant
- ΔE Δt > h/4π
  - E: energy of system
  - t: time
- only relevant in small scale
- if one makes a precise measurement of the position, the momentum will be uncertain
  - Δx small -> Δp large
- vice versa
- for double slit experiment, it is uncertain which slit the particle uses
  - both, first, second
- 1926
  - Physical predictions are inherently probablistic

#### First Quantum Weirdness

- Quantum particles can behave like particles (photoelectric effect) or waves (two-slit)
- the observer can affect the outcome of the experiment
- Quantum physics is inherently probabilistic

### Creation of Mass

- E=mc<sup>2</sup>
- Given some energy, I can create mass
  - creates a particle and antiparticle
    - matter and antimatter
    - electron and positron
    - proton and antiproton
- uncertainty principle allows creation of matter in some Δt
  - ΔE Δt > h/4π
  - allows one to "borrow" energy ΔE for some time
  - create matter using E=mc<sup>2</sup>
  - in a time Δt, energy has to be given back
    - (3 \* 10<sup>-22</sup>) particles annihilate (disappear).
  - We believe that particles are constantly being created and destroyed out of "nothing" (vacuum)
    - vacuum is not truely empty
    - Casimir effect

## Lecture 17

### Quantum in Everyday Life

- Lasers
- Transistors
- Accuracy of atomic clocks (quantum noise)
- quantum cryptography

### Schrödinger's Cat

- put cat in a box with a 50% chance of killing it
- when the cat is in box, it is both dead **and** alive
- only when opened, it is dead **or** alive

---

- Another clue (1910) came from understanding of the spectrum of light emitted when electrical current is passed through a gas
- every element has a unique set of spectrum lines
- combinations of elements can identify what elements are coming from the light
- Neils Bohr explains colours emitted by Hydrogens
  - electrons change energy levels
  - photons with specific energy are absorbed(higher) or emitted(lower)

### Summerize

- light
  - wave and particle properties
    - duality
  - no mass but has energy and momentum
    - E=hf
    - h is Planck's constant
- particles
  - also have wave properties
- moving observer or moving source of light can change the colour of the light
  - redshift/blueshift
- E=Mc<sup>2</sup>
  - empty space isn't truly empty
- General Relativity (1916)
  - all laws of nature are the same for observers moving in an **ARBITRARY** way relative to one another
  - makes the curvature of space a physical variable, describing gravity
    - not a fundamental force

#### Acceleration and Gravitation

- Thought Experiment
  - rocket ship in space with negligible gravitational force
  - constant acceleration
  - astronaut lets go of a ball
    - he sees that the ball falls due to "gravity"
    - from the ball's perspective, the rocket accelerates up to the ball
- **Principle of Equivalence**
  - Einstein: "No experiment performed in one place can distinguish a gravitational field from an accelerated reference frame."
- Thought Experiment
  - astronaut shines light perpendicular to acceleration direction
    - from frame of reference outside spaceship, one would see that the light is bending since the rocket is accelerating up towards the light
    - due to Principle of Equivalence, this means that a gravitational field must also be bending the light in the astronaut's frame of reference
- for 10m, light would take ~30ns
  - light would bend 5 \* 10<sup>-15</sup>

## Lecture 18

- light bend when passing large massive object
- to test it
  - try to find a star that is behind our sun
  - when a solar eclipse occurs we can see the stars during daytime
  - we found that the light has been bent by the sun's gravity
- solar eclipse
  - moon blocks the sun
  - there is a shadow on part of the Earth
- lunar eclipse
  - earth blocks sunlight from hitting the moon, shadows the moon
- we cannot tell the difference between gravity and acceleration

### Gravitational Redshift

- light leaving a gravitational field is "red-shifted"
  - frequency is lowered
  - energy is lowered
  - light needs energy to escape a gravitational field
  - E = h f
    - as E decreases, f decreases
- what happens if gravity is very strong
  - energy of light goes to zero and light doesn't escape
  - Black Holes

### Black Holes

- if a gravitational field is strong enough, light doesn't escape
- time appears to run very slowly
- But at a given distance, the black hole will have the same gravitational strength as a normal star with the same mass
- "black holes don't suck"

### Spacetime

- time moves more slowly when in a strong gravitational field
- Einstein believed that matter and energy are the same
- space-time can be thought of as a grid or "fabric" where one mreasures distances by rulers and measures time by clocks
  - points in space-time are represented as points on a grid
  - the grid can stretch
  - the grid can also be distorted, "warped"
  - Large mass distords "the fabric of space"
    - the warping is called gravity
    - free falling objects follow the most direct path in this curved space-time
      - satellite
      - starlight
      - rocks
- gravity is the manifestation of the distortion of space
- light isn't being bent
  - it it following the curvature of space

### Gravitational Lensing

- galaxies emit light and reaches a massive object like a galaxy cluster
  - light follows the curvature of the space around the massive object
  - the galaxies then look very distorted

### Gravitational Waves

- final prediction of General Relativity to be verified
- disturbances, such as a supernova or collisions of stars should produce gravitational waves which are ripples in spacetime
  - These ripples should be moving outwards
    - Measured in 2015 LIGO

## Lecture 19

- Newton vs General Relativity
  - Gravitational time dilation
  - Gravitational lensing
  - Gravitational redshift
  - Implies the existence of black hole
  - Gravitational waves
- Speed of Gravity
  - prediction
    - travels at the speed of light
    - can't measure light from black holes as no light from black holes
    - measured merging neutron stars
      - light and gravitational wave arrived at the ~same time.

### how does General Relativity match up with Quantum Physics

- very big and the very small
- GR
  - stars, galaxies, black holes, and whole universe
- QP
  - smallest structures, electrons, nuclei, quarks
- **Quantum Gravity**
  - centre of a black hole
  - Universe at the instant of the big bang
- two theories are incompatible at very small distances
  - 10<sup>-35</sup> m
  - quantum jitter introduced by the uncertainty principle is so big that space-time fluctuates violently
  - each particle exerts a gravitational pull on other particles
  - when particles overlap then the meaning of gravity breaks down
- Physicists have postulated that there is a basic very small object called **String**, which can vibrate just like a musical string
  - different vibrations give different elementary particle
  - for string theory to work, it works in 10 space-time dimensions
  - string interactions don't occur at one point
- All valid theories have extra dimensions

---

- masses tell spacetime how to curve
- spacetime tells matter and light how to move

## Lecture 20

### Extrasolar Planet

- IAU "working" definition
  - planets that orbit stars outside our solar system
  - objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium(~13 Jupiter mass) that orbit stars are "planets". THe minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in our solar system.
    - a star is big enough to have a nuclear reactor as a core, whereas planets are not
  - Substellar objects with true masses for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "brown dwarfs", no matter how they formed nor where they are located
    - 3 kinds of objects
      - planets (smallest)
      - brown dwarfs (middle)
        - don't burn hydrogen, instead deuterium (hydrogen isotope)
      - stars (largest)
  - Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate)
    - planets-like objects that aren't orbiting stars
    - formed near star but kicked out
  - Basically
    - Need to be in orbit around a star
    - Can't have nuclear burning like stars do
    - regular planet qualities
      - round-like
      - clear its orbit

#### Searching for extrasolar planets

- transit
  - measuring star's brightness over time
  - when a planet partially eclipses the star, brightness drops
  - we can measure if this behavior is consistent
  - inconsistent
    - planet needs to pass in front of star in our perspective
    - planets that have long orbits are less likely to be considered planets
- Doppler/velocity/wobble
  - use a spectrum of the star to measure its speed of motion towards or away from us. This will change cyclically as its planet orbits around it.
  - star has a small doppler blue/red shift when orbitting around a center of mass
    - the center of mass doesn't have to be in the star (like our sun)
    - planet is large enough to pull on star
  - plots into a sin wave
    - wavelength is one orbit around center of mass for planet and star
  - the plot depends on the size/distance of planet to the star
    - bigger orbit -> slower cycle (wavelength) and smaller effect on star (amplitude)
    - bigger planet -> larger velocity change (amplitude)
    - combine to get mass and orbit size of planet
  - multiple planets will be a sum of sin waves
    - can z-transform into different components
- we have found >600 extrasolar systems with up to 8 stars

## Lecture 21

- Transit Method
  - measures difference in brightness of star over time
  - the difference in brightness is the size of planet moving in front of star
- Doppler/Velocity/Wobble Method
  - find orbit of planet using doppler effect
    - sin wave
  - the wavelength is orbit period of star and planet
  - the amplitude is planet size/orbit size
- we can find mass (doppler) and volume (transit)
  - can find density of planet
    - gas giant
    - rocky planet
- can study the atmosphere of planets using transit method

### Third Method

- Direct Imaging
  - seeing planet directly from special satellite observatories
  - light reflects off planet from stars
  - stars are usually so bright, it overwhelms the reflected light
  - filter out direct light from stars (dim star)
    - coronagraph
- can attempt to look for signs of life/atmosphere
- can find planets farther away than other methods

### Habitable Zone

- region of space where conditions are favourable for life (or at least life like we know it!)
- region around a star where liquid water could exist
  - can extend a little
- Gliese 581g is the first planet found in habitable zone
  - Gliese 581 is a star, with the planets named -a to -g
- most plants are bigger than Earth, smaller than Neptune
  - "super-earth"
- Criticism of habitable zone
  - Life elsewhere could be different than life on Earth
  - Other circumstances can make more distant planets habitable
    - volcanic activities
    - oceans
  - Planet migration
    - planets can move/change orbits over time
    - large planets are more likely to move towards star
      - maybe started in habitable zone, and survive the transition towards/away planet

## Lecture 22

### _Why_ is there life on Earth

- Earth is the only location of life that we know of
  - what conditions have permitted life to arise, _and survive_ on our planet
  - many astronomical conditions to be met
    - we are here because of our connections with the outside universe

### Reasons for Life

- location (habitable zone)
  - liquid water can exist
  - godilocks principle
    - perfect distance
    - not too hot
    - not too cold
- Timing
  - took Earth 4 billion years for a diverse array of multicelled living things to develop
    - simple life forms developed in first billion year
  - Need Star that lasted at least a couple billion years
    - Sun's lifetime is ~9-10 billion years
  - More Massive stars don't last long
    - not long enough for (complex) life to develop
  - Less massive stars have smaller habitable zone
- Atmosphere
  - Greenhouse gasses in atmosphere (carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen to some extent) hold some heat from Sunlight, act as "insulation blanket" and moderate temperature
  - too little atmosphere
    - Mars
    - huge swings in surface temperature during day
  - too much atmosphere
    - Venus
    - too much "insulation"
    - too much heat is trapped from Sunglight and held in and builds up
      - "runaway" greenhouse effect
- Water
  - medium for biochemical reaction
  - too much water
    - continental shelves are thought to be important for rapid development of life
  - theory of water origins
    - early heavy bombardment stage (4.5-4.0 billion years ago)
      - brought most/all ocean water from comets
- Global Climate Issues
  - Catastrophic changes in climate are possible
    - Snowball Earth
      - 500 million years ago
      - entire earth is covered in ice
      - ice reflects energy away
        - further cooling
        - runaway effect
      - widespread glaciation
      - reverses if more active volcanism
- Is the solar system a safe place to live
  - Mass extinctions of life have occurred a few times on the Earth in the past
  - Cretaceous era extinction of dinosaurs
    - thought to be earth-crossing asteroid
    - earth-crossing asteroid is asteroid that passes really close to earth
    - if the asteroid is big enough and
      - hits water
        - water vapour goes into the ski
        - runaway greenhouse gas effect
      - hits land
        - dust fills the sky
        - reflects sunlight back
        - disrupts food chain on earth/ocean
        - global firestorm
    - thought to be 10km in size
  - Earth orbit is very large so it is really rare to hit asteroid
  - thought that Jupiter excites asteroids in asteroid belt into inner orbit
  - Aestroids
    - not usually 1 solid piece
    - 100 meters or less
      - earth encouters many times a century
      - breaks up in Earth's atmosphere
    - a few kilometers
      - once every few thousand years
      - major damage on continent-size scales
    - 10-100 kilometers
      - once every 100 million years
      - very threatening to biosphere
    - Jupiter sends the aestroids but also absorbs lots of comets
- Death from the stars
  - supernova (explosion of massive star at end of its life)
    - Destruction of our ozone layer
    - exposure to much increased radiation
  - average rate is 1 per century in our galaxy
    - usually too far to affect Earth
  - maybe one every 300 million years within 30 lightyears of Sun
    - will destroy life on Earth

  - Oxygen and Methane mass produced by bacteria
- very difficult observations
  - planets are very small and faint compared to big bright stars
  - need very long exposures and good instruments
- Mass-Radius Diagram
  - Radius vs Mass of planets found
    - radius from transit method
    - mass from doppler shift
  - lots of uncertainty
    - especially mass
  - lines draw constant density as mass/radius increases

  - Pheonix project
    - searches for radio signals from extraterrestrials
    - stared at 800 stars
      - failed to find any evidence of extraterrestrial signals
- look for repeating patterns of signals
  - narrow signals (very small frequency) are much more likely to be artificial
  - need to rule out Earth signals
  - Stars give out very little radio signal
- radio and optical
- lasers
  - light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation
  - not possible in nature

## Lecture 24

- Statistics of life in the universe
  - Drake equation
    - estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy with which we might come in contact
    - main purpose is to quantify the uncertainty factors which determine the number of such extraterrestrial civilizations
    - _N = R<sup>\*</sup>×f<sub>p</sub>×n<sub>e</sub>×f<sub>l</sub>×f<sub>i</sub>×f<sub>c</sub>×L_
      - _N_: numer of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible
      - _R<sup>\*</sup>_: average rate of star formation in our galaxy
      - _f<sub>p</sub>_: fraction of those stars have planets
      - _n<sub>e</sub>_: average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets
      - _f<sub>l</sub>_: fraction of above that actually go on to develop life at some point
      - _f<sub>i</sub>_: fraction of above that actually go on to develop intelligent life
      - _f<sub>c</sub>_: fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space
      - _L_: length of the time such civilizations release detectable signals into space
    - we have a good idea of R<sup>\*</sup> and f<sub>p</sub>
    - we potentially know f<sub>p</sub>
  - Revised Drake Equation

### Sending Messages to space

- Arecibo message
  - sent encoded messages to space
- Voyager Golden Record
  - Voyager 1 and Voyager 2
  - engraved on these record are information about human knowledge
    - atoms
    - humans
    - solar systems
  - on the records
    - greetings in many languages
    - music from many cultures
    - animal and nature sounds
  - audio contents are released
- Should we be sending messages?
  - Stephen Hawking and others think not
  - aliens can potentially be hostile
- People can pay to send signals to space
- Could other Civilizations see us?
  - only if they are close
  - biosignatures have been present on Earth for billions of years but organized, intelligent signals are relatively new:
    - earlist TV broadcasts have reached several thousand stars
    - signal is very weak and would require very large antenna.

### Fermi Paradox

- plausible arguments (Drake Equation) suggest that civilizations should be common.
  - 1 in 1 million stars gets a civilization at some time => 100,000 civilizations
  - 1 in 1 billion stars gets a civilization at some time => 100 civilizations
- why haven't we detected them?
- why haven't they visited us?
- Solutions
  - Maybe extraterrestrial life is more rare than we think
  - Intersteller travel is really ahrd
  - Civilizations destroy themselves before achieving interstellar travel?
  - Advanced communication technology doesn't exist elsewhere?
    - we don't know how to listen property
  - Everyone is listening, but no one is transmitting
  - hard to satisfy the factors for life

### Formation of our Solar System

- solar nebula
  - solar medium (gas and dust) collapse
- contracts into rotating disk- star forms in centre
  - big ball of mostly hydrogen, little bit of helium
- cooling causing condensing into tiny (dust sized) solid particles
- collisions between these form larger bodies
- these accrete to form planets
  - terrestrial planets form close in, gas giants further out
  - other solar systems with gas giants close to star must mean gas giants migrate towards the star

#### Comets form in outer portion of the disk around the young star

- same area as gas giants
- icy bodies
- get flung by big planets out of the solar system
- most of the Comets live in Oort Cloud
  - 50000 AU
- nearby passing star preturb comets and move it
  - tail is from solar radiation chipping away at the comet when moving by the Sun
- why should we care about comets and Kuiper Belt Objects
  - Kuiper Belt and Oort CLoud are relatively pristine remnants of the nebula from which the entire solar system was formed
  - compositions and distribution places important constraints on models of early evolutions of the solar system
    - knowing the compositions of these objects can allow us to better simulate how solar systems are formed

---

### Objects in Solar System

- Asteroids
  - rocky objects, mostly live in a belt between Mars and Jupiter, some asteroids do cross the path of the Earth
- Comets
  - 'Dirty Snowballs'
  - icy objects, mostly live in the Oort Cloud
  - Only see the tail when it starts to melt
- Oort Cloud
  - spherical cloud of comets ~50,000 times further away from the Sun than Earth
- Kuiper Belt Objects
  - mostly icy objects living just past the orbit of Neptune
- Meteors
  - "shooting stars"
  - streaks of light caused when pieces of asteroids or comets hit the Earth's atmoshere(if pieces survive intact, called meteorites)
  - any thing that burns in atmosphere and leaves a track

## Lecture 25

- Learning more about stars

### Our Sun

- "low mass" star
- how long will the Sun last
  - our sun lasts around 10 billion years
  - ~5.5 billion left
- what's goning to happen to the Sun
  - grow and get hotter (red giant)
  - Shed off atmosphere (planetary nebula)
  - Core remains for ~trillion years (white dwarf)

#### Stellar longevity

- A star "dies" when it runs out of fuel to burn
  - depends on **MASS** and **LUMINOSITY**
- **MASS** related to the amount of fuel available
- **LUMINOSITY** related to the rate at which fuel is used up
  - how fast nuclear fusion is occurring
- lifetime is porportional to
  - **MASS**/**LUMINOSITY**
- low mass stars live much longer
  - high mass stars are way more luminous (exponentially?)
- how old is the Sun?
  - we build models of stars that show how they will evolve for a given mass and "luminosity"
    - ~4.5 billion years age for our sun
  - we also use radioactive dating to see how old the sun is
    - nothing is older than ~4.5 billion years old

#### Nuclear Reactions

- 2 particles
  - a, x
- "wall" of electric repulsion
  - a and x are same charge
- can be bypassed by quantum tunnelling
  - become glued by STRONG force -> NUCLEAR FUSION
- Stars have so many hydrogen atoms in its core that it happens consistently
- 1 kg H -> 0.993 kg He
  - difference in mass is converted to energy
    - E = mc<sup>2</sup>
- fusion can generate energy up to iron
  - fission also generates energy up to iron
- What happens as sun burns hydrogen into helium?
  - Main Sequence
  - "Proton-proton chain" (p-p chain)
    - builds up helium in star's centre
    - The star gradually gets bigger and brighter
    - 4 Hydrogen atoms -> 1 Helium atom
  - Sun burns 4.3 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second
    - 3.8 \* 10<sup>26</sup> Joules
    - roughly 1 million times the amount of energy humans consume in one year
- what happens as the star uses up its fuel?
  - Hydrogen burns in a shell surrounding Helium ash
  - Helium core will gradually shrink
    - due to gravity
    - become hotter
  - ~100 million degrees
    - helium nuclei are slamming into each other with enough force to fuse
    - creates Carbon (and Oxygen)
- nuclear fusion exerts pressure outwards toward the surface
  - in equilibrium with gravity pushing inwards toward the core
- final stages of a low-mass star
  - star becomes big and bright ("Red Giant")
    - toasts Earth
    - engulfs earth
  - star loses mass gently
    - planetary nebula
      - outer layers of material are ejected into interstellar medium
      - 10's of thousands of years
    - white dwarf
      - white hot core left behind

## Lecture 26

- Life Cycle of the Sun
  - right now we are in a relatively stable phase
  - eventually it will become a red gaint
    - will undergo planetary nebula
      - outer portions blow off through wind
    - becomes a white dwarf
      - dead

### White Dwarf

- Burnt out core
  - about the size of the earth
  - still comparable in mass to the present sun
- faintly luminous
  - initially hot but no more nuclear burning
    - 100 000 K
- fate of our sun ~5 billion years from now
  - 97% of the stars will end up as a white dwarf
- teaspoon of a typical white dwarf's matter would weigh 5.5 tons
  - mass of an elephant
- gravitationally stable because pressure from packing atoms so tightly
  - degeneracy pressure
- Fusion stops in low mass stars because the core temperature never gets hot enough to fuse heavier elements
- white dwarf is basically a bunch of carbon and oxygen atoms packed super tightly together
- White dwarfs start out hot and spend the rest of eternity getting cooler and cooler
- Seed the interstellar medium with fresh material
  - carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen
  - material for new stars

### High-Mass Star

- 8 times heavier than the Sun
- live fast, die young
- evolution is determined by the relationship between gravity, pressure, and luminosity (rate of nuclear burning)
- life time of a star
  - ~mass/luminosity
  - more mass
  - -> stronger gravity
  - -> higher pressure
  - -> faster nuclear reaction rates
  - -> greater luminosity

#### Nuclear Burning in high-mass stars

- Higher temperature means that additional nuclear reactions can happen
- Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen Cycle burns hydrogen in massive stars
  - CNO cycle
- more efficient at burning hydrogen than the PP chain
  - proton-proton chain
  - carbon is a catalyst for 4H -> He
    - \+ some neutrinos and gamma rays
- Centre: Hydrogen burning followed by helium burning
  - once helium is exhausted, core collapses, heats up and starts burning carbon
  - carbon burning makes sodium, neon, and magnesium, etc.
  - high mass means enough pressure and heat
- onion structure of a high mass star
  - more and more layers as high mass stars age
    - heavier elements are inside
  - ends at iron
- each time burning new elements, new equilibrium needs to be reached
- at iron, no more pressure will be exerted
  - gravity wins
  - star implodes
- final days in the life
  - hydrogen burning: 10 million years
  - helium burning: 1 million years
  - carbon burning: 1000 years
  - oxygen burning: 1 year
  - silicon burning: a few days
  - iron burning: no burning

#### After Nuclear Burning

- Supernova Explosion
  - standard brightness (like a candle)
  - as bright as a galaxy
- can monitor remnants for years after
- iron core collapses on itself
  - reaching speed of 70 000 km / second
- collapsing core bounces back outward
  - supernova
- 1987a
  - observed supernova
  - large magellanic cloud
  - closest supernova that occured
- 10 000 times more enegy is carried away by neutrinos

#### Star Lifetimes

| star mass (solar masses) | time (years)    |
| ------------------------ | --------------- |
| 60                       | 3 million       |
| 30                       | 11 million      |
| 10                       | 32 million      |
| 3                        | 370 million     |
| 1.5                      | 3 billion       |
| 1                        | 10 billion      |
| 0.1                      | 1000's billions |

## Lecture 27

- legecy of supernova
  - distributes heavy elements in the ISM
  - blast may compress nearby clouds, triggering the formation of generations of stars

### what is left behind in a supernova

- if the mass of the collapsing supernova core
- &le; 3 solar masses
  - neutrons are squeezed tightly together in the core
  - "Neutron-degenerate" core
    - Neutron Star
    - more dense than white dwarfs
    - 1 solar mass in an area of 10km radius
    - earth's mass fit into a football stadium
    - sugar lump would weigh 400 billion tons
- \> 3 solar masses
  - black hole

### What are Black Holes

- Earth's escape velocity at suface
  - as is: 40000 km/hr
  - squeezed into 1cm radius: > speed of light
    - black hole
- Squeezing Sun down to a radius of 3km
- Human squeezed to a billionth of a proton's radius
- objects with gravity so intense that light cannot escape them
- Gravity vs Pressure
  - Normal star
    - gravity is balanced by pressure from nuclear fusion
  - White dwarf
    - gravity balanced from pressure from not being able to pack carbonand oxygen atoms any tighter
    - degeneracy pressure
  - Neutron star
    - gravity balanced by pressure from not being able to pack neutrons together any tighter
  - Black hole
    - gravity not balanced, total collapse

#### Event Horizon

- we consider the size of black hole by its event horizon
  - the radius at which the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light
- every object has a critical size below which it becomes a black hole
  - Schwarzschild radius
    - larger the mass, larger the critical radius
- information barrier, not a physical surface
  - impossible to know what happens inside a black hole, as nothing can escape once entered

#### Escape Velocity

| Object       | Escape Velocity |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| White Dwarf  | ~5000 km/s      |
| Neutron Star | ~100 000 km/s   |
| Black Hole   | ~300 000 km/s   |

- high escape velocity = high spacetime curvature
- centre of black hole: infinite spacetime curvature
  - hole in the grid
- can one cross the event horizon and survive
  - small black hole (< 100 AU)
    - force of gravity at feet is a trillion times stronger than at your head
  - large blacj hole (> 100 000 AU)
    - OK
    - just can't escape again
- watch from a safe distance
  - person would run more slowly as the event horizon is approached, and stop once there
    - they take an infinite time to fall in
  - friend would look redder and redder until horizon is reached
    - photons are gravitationally redshifted to _infinite_ wavelengths (zero energy)

#### Beyond Event Horizon

- General realtivity: point of infinite density
- Law of physics break down
- Need theory of quantum gravity to understand better
  - under construction

#### Observing Black Holes

- Can't see them directly
- look for gravitational effects on surroundings
- Candidates:
  - Two-star systems
    - massive stars are more likely to form in a binary system or triplet system
    - the more massive star collapses first
    - the other star expands to a red supergiant
    - black hole can steal matter from the outer layer
    - material will orbit into the black hole. Glows in X-Ray as it orbits really fast
    - Cygnus X-1
  - Centre of galaxies
    - Supermassive Black holes in the Centre of Galaxies
    - look at stars near the galactic centre
    - Measure speed as they orbit the centre
    - from the speeds, calculate the mass of the central orbit
    - can infer if it is a black hole
    - Milky Way:
      - 3 million solar masses
      - 20 light years across
      - no light given off

## Lecture 28

- gravitational force is related to mass/radius<sup>2</sup>
- in black hole, the surface radius is way smaller than a star of the same mass
- far enough away, can treat the two as point source masses
- How to find black holes
  - x-ray binaries
    - stellar mass black holes
  - orbits of stars in the middle of our galaxy
    - supermassive black holes
- material falling into a black hole spins, forming a disk around the black hole as its orbit speeds up.
  - also gets hotter
- some material will get ejected from a black hole
  - jets
  - only supermassive black holes
- black holes are common in galaxy evolution
- forms gravitational waves

### EHT

- larger the telescope, the better the resolution
- interferometer
  - combine data from different telescopes
  - acts as a huge telescope
    - called baseline
- EHT
  - combine data from different interferometers
  - forms a baseline as large as the Earth
  - ALMA + EHT forms the biggest telescope

---

- Two kinds of Black Holes
  - Stellar Mass (from supernovae)
  - Supermassive (in the center of galaxies)
- how are supermassive blackholes made?
  - still a big question
  - how much is the mass from matter falling in vs there initially

### Hertzsprung-Russell diagram

- or Colour-Magnitude diagram
- stars are great black bodies
- brighter stars are higher frequency wavelengths (bluer)
- most stars lie on the main sequence line in the graph
- neutron stars are very faint
- within 5pc of our Sun, majority of stars are low mass
- brightest stars in our skies are mostly super luminous stars
- Hipparcos (1989)
  - measures accurate distances out to 200pc
- Gaia (2015)
  - measures accurate distances out to 25 000pc
- globular cluster
  - millions of stars
  - shows the lifetime of a star in a cluster
  - a cutoff would occur in the main sequence
    - can show the age of a population of a cluster of stars
  - as stars evolve, they move from the main sequence to the giant branch
  - big stars do it faster
  - length of main sequence tell its age
    - shorter -> older

## Lecture 29

### Introduction to Cosmology

- most of physics consists of things that can be measured and tested in lab experiments (even things like relativistic time dilation and quantum mechanical effects).
- Cosmology is a bit differen
  - not an experimental science
  - observational science
    - can't study the objects in a lab or run controlled experiments on them
    - objects are (mostly) out of reach

#### Cosmic Background Radiation

- 1965:
  - Penzias & Wilson
    - testing a new type of microwave antenna
    - whole sky is filled with cold, low energy radio waves
      - microwaves
    - white noise on analog television
  - further measurements showed that this radiation was coming from every direction in the sky, at the same intensity
  - not associated with any particular object
  - Conclusion
    - radiation fills all of space
    - Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR)
      - Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR)
      - Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
      - CMB=CBR=CMBR

---

- all evidence so far
  - Universe is expanding (Hubble's Law)
  - beginning time of 13-14 billion years ago
  - filled with cool, low-energy microwave radiation
- earlier times, CBR was shorter wavelength, more closely packed
  - space was filled with hotter radiation
  - 2.7 degrees above absolute zero
  - no limit to how "cold" or "hot" the CBR can get

### Early Universe Introduction

- Goals:
  - Understand the hot early universe (post big bang)
  - Understand formation of elements (nucleosynthesis)
  - Understand where CBR comes from
- further in the past you go
  - sea of elementary particles, radiation
  - hot, dense
- Heirarchical growth
  - Sub-atomic particles
  - atoms
  - stars
  - galaxies
  - clusters of galaxies
- more and more complexity develops in the universe as time goes on

#### Big Bang

- 13.8 billion years ago
- big bang model refers to a hot early universe
  - universe evolved from an extremely hot and dense early state
- Looking at the conditions a few seconds later:
  - space is uniformly filled with hot radiation and subatomic particles
    - 100 million degrees or so
    - ~inside of a star
  - everything is expanding rapidly
  - only electrons, protons, neutrons, and photons
  - hot enough for nuclear fusion to take place
    - Big-Bang nucleosynthesis
  - this state lasts a few minutes
- after Big-Bang nucleosynthesis
  - hydrogen (9 ions out of 10)
    - 75% by mass
  - helium (1 ion out of 10)
    - 25% by mass
  - radiation (photons)
  - maybe a tiny bit of Lithium
- 98% of helium present in Universe was made in nucleosynthesis
- after the next half hour (lithium 7 was created), Universe cooled and expanded to point where fusion of heavier elements was impossible

## Lecture 30

### Viewing the Big Bang

- beginning of universe was so hot, no bodies in space could exist
- we can't see the Big Bang
  - free electrons are very effective at interacting with light
  - photons gets deflected and scattered
  - foggy at large distances
  - light from that far back has been scattered and blurred out of recognition
- after nuclear fusion
  - hot gas gets cooler and more spread-out
  - eventually electrons latch on to nuclei (protons)
  - 3000 degrees Kelvin
- becomes neutral atomic gas, where electrons are combined with nuclei
  - only photons with specific wavelength can interact with neutral gas
  - "Mean free path" of the light is now much larger
  - transition happened about 380 000 (400 000) years after the start of the Big Bang
  - key turning point
  - races can be seen in the CBR light
  - Surface of last scattering
  - we can't see beyond this time
- mostly measure the effects of Big Bang rather than the Big Bang itself
- what did the universe look like
  - "baby picture"
  - has a little bit of structure
    - tiny place-to-place differences in the CBR temperature
      - few parts per million
    - ever so slightly differences in temperature and different densities
  - WMAP (wilkinson Microwave Anisotrophy Probe)
  - projection of an inside of a sphere

### Time Line of Big Bang

| T                   |                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                   | Big Bang                                                      |
| few seconds-minutes | Nucleosynthesis (helium produce, universe is totally ionized) |
| ~300 000 - 400 000  | Cosmic Microwave Background                                   |

---

- spectrum graph of stars show the elements of star
- almost all stars have
  - ~90% hydrogen
  - ~10% helium
  - ~1% everything else
- very similar of ratio with elements created in early universe
- consistent picture is starting to emerge
  - first rapid phase of Big Bang produces hot gas with very simple atomic composition
    - hydrogen and little helium
  - this gas starts to form into stars soon after
    - few hundred million years
    - galaxies build up as more star form, gas clouds collect together into bigger assemblies

## Lecture 31

- how old are the oldest stars?
  - SUn is 4.6 billion years old
  - there are both younger and older stars to be found
  - Orion Nebula are only few million years old
  - globular cluster are near 13 billion years old
    - similar to "Hubble Time"
    - universe has to be at least this old
  - nothing older has been found
- Evidence for Big Bang
  - Cosmic Background Radiation
  - Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
  - Hubble Expansion
  - Homogeneity of universe (homogeneous = same)
  - Age of stars
    - indirect tests of cosmology is to determine the age of the Universe from the oldest objects in the Universe
- Big Bang is not about an explosion
  - it is a rapid expansion and cooling
  - "Hot Dense Early Universe"

### Big Crunch

- universe is currently expanding
  - it might expand forever
  - it might collapse and make a new big bang
    - Big Crunch
  - depends of the balance between the expansion rate and gravity
- Detailed map of te CBR temperature contains a lot more information
  - a suggestion about whether the universe is going to expand forever
- Gravity continually tries to stop the expansion.
  - will it succeed?
  - if so, when?
- if there is more mass,
  - the blobs in the CBR will be bigger
  - the CBR map will look patchy with bigger blobs on it (magnified in size)
- if there is less mass,
  - the CBR map will look smoother with smaller featers on ti
  - the actual degree of the patchiness if tge CBR suggest which option is correct
    - the typical size of the patches is the key
- most microwave radiation is blocked by atmosphere
  - thats why satellite is ideal
  - a cheaper option is to build a balloon to be in the atmosphere
    - BOOMERanG experiment
    - can't see the entire sky
- the actual degree of patchiness has been measured in detail and compared predictions from calculations
  - There isn't enough matter in space to stop the expansion
  - it will continue to expand indefinitely
    - unless there are complications
- the denser regions in CBR is where stars, galaxies, planets form

### What happened in the first fraction of a second

- how did the expansion begin
- Inflation Era
- add-on to the basic Big Bang cosmology
- more speculative
- time after t=1 second is based on "safe physics
- 1 millionth of a second after the Big Bang
  - all matter dissolved into "quark plasma"
    - electron
    - neutrino
    - quark
    - photons
  - leads into nucleosynthesis
- 10<sup>-37</sup> seconds
