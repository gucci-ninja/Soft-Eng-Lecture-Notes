## Lecture 4

### Dwarf Planets

- Beyond Neptune, in the Kuiper belt, there are a Kuiper Belt Objects
  - 2005 new KBO bigger than Pluto
    - Pluto no longer a planet
  - This object with several other objects as big as Pluto are called dwarf planets
- To find KBO, we take photos over a time frame and the distance travelled over the timeframe will show what it is
  - fast: asteroid
  - medium: KBO
  - slow: star
  - unmoving: galaxy?
- Definition:
  - is in orbit around the Sun
  - is close to round in shape
    - big enough objects in space will be round due to gravity
  - intersect with other dwarf planet/planet orbits.
    - has not "cleared the neighborhood"
  - is not a satellite
- small solar object: non-round objects orbitting the sun

### Sun

- giant gas ball
  - relative to planets
  - 99.8% of the mass in our solar system
- prominence are common
- transit
  - shadow of planets across star's surface
- middle aged
  - gets bigger and brighter as it ages

| Gas Giant          | Terrestrial Planet    |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| no solid surface   | solid (rocky) surface |
| solid/liquid cores | may have atmosphere   |

### Belts

- Between Mars and Jupiter is Asteroid Belt
- Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt
  - Largest Objects in Kuiper Belt are called Dwarf Planets

### Interstellar space

- a million times larger than interplanetary space
- a million times smaller than intergalactic space

## Lecture 5

### interstellar space

- space between stars

  - usually thin gaseous material
  - giant interstellar gas clouds collapse due to gravity and becomes a star

- best way measure distance of nearby star: parallax star

  - in 6 month difference, see how much a star moves relative to background stars
  - closer the star, the bigger the movement of the star.
  - done since the 1800
  - easier for bigger orbits

- parsec or lightyear is used to measure far objects

  - parsec is around 3.3 lightyears
  - 1.3 parsec is around 4 lightyears (closest star)

- milky way has two satallite galaxies
- gaia space mission measures 1.7 billion stars

### intergalactic space

- million times larger than interstellar distances
- use Megaparsecs (million parsec) => millions of lightyears

- spiral galaxy

  - typical spiral galaxy has around 100 billion stars
    - has arms coming from the center
    - many new stars form along the arms
  - shaped like a frisbee, rotating
  - can be tens of thousands of lightyears across
  - density of stars decrease as we go closer to the edge
  - face on vs edge on are different angles to view galaxies
  - center has a bulge, flat at the edge

- eliptical galaxy

  - a lot less structure
    - bright center and fade towards the edge
  - not a disc like spiral galaxy
  - swarm of bees
  - very little gas

- galaxy zoo
  - crowdsource galaxy names

### galaxy collections

- galaxy groups: at least 3 galaxies affected by one another
- compact galaxy group

  - distances between galaxies are within each other's edge

- galaxy clusters: thousands of member galaxies
  - largest galaxies in the universe usually center of galaxy clusters
    - 1 trillion stars
  - clusters have different context when used to describe galaxy clusters vs star clusters

### Lookback Time

- light requires time to travel
- if light from far away travels to us, it takes longer than if the source was close by
- we are therefore always looking at the object in the past.
- used in galaxy evolution field.

## Lecture 6

### simulation

- how galaxys interact with nearby galaxies
  - giant gravity throws stars
  - colours change over time
    - blue: newer stars formations
    - red: merged galaxies
  - spiral galaxies merge to become eliptical galaxy

### cosmology

- study of origin and evolution of universe
- discovered in 1930 galaxies are getting farther away

  - implies universe is expanding (exponentially)

- distance to galaxies

  - can't use parallax
  - we compare with conventional knowledge (standard candle effect)
    - some objects has the same brightness always (supernova)
    - we take the amount of light coming from these objects to see how far they are
    - not precise and too slow
  - velocity of galaxy (Doppler shift)
    - light waves will stretch and squish as galaxies move
    - galaxies moving away shifts towards infrared (**redshift**)
    - galaxies moving towards shifts towards ultraviolet (**blueshift**)
    - to find if the lights are shifting
      - we find the spectrum lines of the elements making up the object giving off the light
      - if the spectrum lines are slightly more red or blue, it has shifted
    - every galaxy has a unique spectrum line
    - can measure distance and speed very percisely
      - larger distance, the faster it is moving away
      - almost all galaxies are redshifted
    - discovered by Edwin Hubble
      - Hubble's Law
      - Hubble-Lemaitre Law
        - Speed is porportional to distance
        - V = (Hubble's constant) \* distance
        - **V = H \* d**

- Expanding Universe
  - rather than galaxies moving
  - space is expanding between galaxies
  - raisin bread analogy
    - distance between raisins gets larger when bread rises

## Lecture 7

- **Hubble-Lemaitre Law**
  - relation between motion of a galaxy and its distance from us:
    - Speed: measured from amount of Doppler shift
      - towards infrared: moving farther
      - towards ultraviolet: moving closer
    - Distance: measured with standard candle technique
      - fainter = further
  - further away, the faster the speed
  - V = H \* d
- galaxies are not moving, rather the universe is expanding, and the space between galaxies are expanding

### Hubble's Law

- overall appearance of the universe should be changing with time
  - long ago, they are closer together
  - we can see this by looking farther
    - the father the object, the longer it takes the light to reach us
- universe may have a beginning
  - v = H \* d
    - speed = constant \* distance
  - d = v \* 1/H
    - distance = speed \* time
    - 1/H is a time
      - is time since expansion began
      - around **13 billion years** (13.8)
      - assumes rate of expansion is constant
  - to check
    - is the expansion the same in all directions
      - yes
    - measure galaxies in many different directions and find that 1/H is around the same
- what is the universe spanding into
- if universe is finite, what is beyond the universe
- will we reach a time where space was just dark and empty

## Lecture 8

- 2 ways to collect data:
  1. Imaging=Pictures
  2. Spectroscopy=Spectrum

### Imaging

- take pictures in Red, Green, Blue and combine them
  - pictures are taken greyscale with rgb filter
    - shows how much red, green, blue exist
  - cam take photos beyond visible spectrum
  - computer adds colour and combines the 3 pictures
- pretty

### Spectroscopy

- measure how much light at every wavelength
- specific wavelengths have extra light
  - plot in a graph
- can find out what objects in universe are made of

### Atmospheric Opacity

- astronomers can't view everything from the surface on the earth
- many times, we need to send telescopes into space
- Ultraviolet and shorter is blocked
- visible light is visible with little distortion
- visible spectrum is absorbed
- radiowave is observable
- longer wavelength is blocked
- Sound is not a electromagnetic radiation
  - it is a pressure wave
  - cannot travel through space

## Lecture 9

### Basic Physics

#### Space and distance

- meter (m)

| object                | size (~m)            |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| you                   | 2                    |
| distance to the sun   | 10<sup>11</sup>      |
| to the nearest galaxy | 2 \* 10<sup>22</sup> |
| size of atom          | 10<sup>-10</sup>     |

- 1960 the meter was defined in context of atomic physics
  - certain colour wavelengths from krypton (kr) isotope

#### Time

- second (s)

| object   | age (~s)             |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| you      | 6 \* 10<sup>8</sup>  |
| universe | 4 \* 10<sup>17</sup> |

- defined to be a certain number of vibrations of cesium atom (Cs)
  - standardized

#### Mass

- kilogram (kg)
- measure of "inertia"
  - the greater the mass, the greater
- defined in terms of Planck constant

#### Speed

- distance travelled over time it takes to get there
- meters per second (m/s)
- all electromagnetic radiation travels at the same speed (c)
  - ~300000000 m/s
  - the fastest anything in the universe can travel at
- distance travelled can be calculated
  - d = v \* t
    - d = distance travelled
    - v = velocity
    - t = time
  - some distances are used frequently to be used as constants
    - light year: time it takes light to travel in a year
      - d = c \* t
      - d ~ 10<sup>16</sup>

#### Prefix

- can use prefix for different orders of magnitudes

### Fundamental Forces

#### Gravity

- attraction of one mass on another
- scales with mass and distance
- the balance of gravity and kinetic energy from the motions of stars are balanced in a galaxy to keep it from collapsing or dispersing
  - too little kinetic energy, the galaxy would collapse
  - too much kinetic energy, the galaxy would disperse into a new equilibrium
- strength of 10<sup>-38</sup>

#### Strong force

- holds atom nucli together
- very short range
- strength of 1
- strongest force

#### Electromagnetic force

- holds atoms together
- infinite range
- strength of 0.01

#### Weak force

- causes nuclear decay
- very short range
- strength of 0.00001

#### Gravitational force

- between two objects
- depends on
  - mass
  - distance between the objects _r_ (from the center of the object)
  - gravitational constant _G_
- _F_ = _G_ \* (_M<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2</sub>_)/_r<sup>2</sup>_

## Lecture 10

- 4 fundamental forces
  - strong force
    - short range
    - strength 1
  - electromagnetic force
    - infinite range
    - strength 0.01
  - weak force
    - very short range
    - 0.00001
  - gravity
    - infinite range
    - 10<sup>-38</sup>

### Why is gravity so much weaker

- much weaker than other forces
  - gravitational constant G is much smaller than other fundamental force constants
- Theory is we live in a **3+1 dimension**
  - we talk about
    - left and right
    - back and forth
    - up and down
  - 3 space dimensions (3D)
  - 1 temporal dimension (time)
  - allows us to uniqely define any event in the universe
    - where and when it occurs
  - maybe gravity is similar strength in other dimensions that we can't observe
  - quantum gravity
    - string theory

#### Weight

- force of gravity on an object
- mass is a constant

#### Balance of forces

- person sitting in a chair doesn't fall through
  - due to electromagnetic forces
  - electrons in body repel electrons in chair

#### 2013 Ig Nobel Physics

- Humans are physically capable of running across the surface of a pond if on the moon

#### Relativity (modern gravity)

- Relative motion
  - why does javelin thrower run with javelin
  - javelin speed is run speed + throw speed
  - javelin is faster relative to ground

## Lecture 11

- Javelin throwers run before they throw
  - javelin will be faster as its total speed is running speed + throwing speed

### Special Relativity

- 1905
  - Einstein published special theory of relativity
  - believed that light is same speed for every frame of reference
- example
  - two people
    - one is on earth
    - one is moving 1 000 000 m/s relative to first person
  - they see light moving towards them
    - what is the speed of the light
    - both are the **same**
- example
  - two rocket ships
    - both moving 1 000 000 m/s
    - one throws a teddy bear 250m/s
      - teddy bear is moving 1 000 250 m/s relative to stationary observer
    - one flashes light
      - light is moving at speed of light (no changes)
- nothing can move faster than speed of light
  - objects moving at the speed of light must have 0 mass
- every frame of reference measures speed of light as c
- nothing can move faster than speed of light
- anything with mass moves slower than c
- only massless objects can move at speed of light

#### Relativity of Simultaneity

- events which are simultaneous in one frame may not be in another
- each observer of the event is correct with their interpretation of the event
  - each observer is in their own frame of reference

#### Consequences of Special Relativity (time)

- 2 observers moving .99c relative to each other
  - their ideas of time and distance will be muddled.
- Time
  - time taken for light to travel to mirror and back from source
  - d = v \* t
  - t = d/c = 2\*x/c
    x = distance to mirror from source
  - if observer was moving relative to light
    - distance(d) travel will be farther
    - time taken(t) will be larger
  - moving clocks run slowly

## Lecture 12

### Time Dialation

- moving clocks run slowly
- Time = distance/speed of light
- Box with light bouncing between two mirrors
  - observing same frame of reference
    - light is traveling the length of the mirrors
  - observing in a different frame of reference
    - light is travelling a longer distance between mirrors
    - the faster the light is travelling from our frame of reference, the farther the light travels
      - the longer it takes for light to move.
- every frame of reference is still and other frames of reference is always moving relative to it.
- time is slower depending on speed v
  - slower by factor γ
  - γ = 1/(1-v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>
  - isn't significant (measurable) until v=0.5c

### Length Contraction

- objects seen in a different(moving) reference frames appear shorter along the direction of motion
- c = d/t
  - if time changes when viewing from different frames of reference, distance must as well
  - time increases
  - therefore distance decreases

### Consequences Special Relativity

- time dialation
- length contraction
- no absolute simultaneity
- all measurements are relative to observer
- Special Relativity in everyday life
  - GPS
  - particle accelerators
  - heavy elements
    - electrons of heavy elements are affected by relativity

### Einstein's famous equation

- E = mc<sup>2</sup>
- E: energy
- m: mass
- c: speed of light
- mass and energy is the same thing
- very hard to convert mass to energy
- moving mass is larger than still mass
  - m = γm<sub>0</sub>
  - m<sub>0</sub>: mass at rest
  - mass of an object would be infinite if it is moving at c

## Lecture 14

### 3D SpaceTime Diagram

- Light Cone represents light moving away from us or towards us

### Quantum World-Light

- what is light?
  - behaves as a wave
- speed: **c**
- frequency: **f**
  - same as pitch
  - Hz
  - how many times per second does wave repeat
    - number of wavelengths per second
- wavelength **λ**
  - distance before wave repeats itself
  - distance between tops/bottoms
- speed = frequency\*wavelength
  - speed is always constant
  - f bigger λ smaller
  - f smaller λ bigger
- in order of increasing frequency (and therefore energy)
  - radio
  - infrared
  - visible (red-violet)
  - ultraviolet
  - X ray
  - gamma rays
- running towards light
  - blueshift
  - more waves per unit time
  - higher frequency
- running away from light
  - redshift
  - less waves per unit time
  - lower frequency

#### Quantum Weirdness

- everyday experience doesn't prepare for what happens at high speeds (relativity)
- it also doesn't help us with very small objects (quantum mechanics)

### Quantum Physics

- Quantum Mechanics (1926)
  - Newton's laws break down when applied to distances comparable to the size of an atom
- 1899
  - attempting to understand "blackbody" radiation
  - hot objects glow with a spectrum of colours depending only on temperature, not chemical compositions
    - stars are really good blackbodies
  - hotter temperature is "bluer"
  - cooler temperature is "redder"
- 1900
  - Max Planck explained black body radiation
  - light came in small "chunks" or quanta
  - Nobel Prize for Physics 1918
