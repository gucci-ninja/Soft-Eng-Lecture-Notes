# Sustainability

## Lecture 1

### Historical Context of Sustainability

- 5 greatest inventions
  - internet
  - cooking
  - language
  - tools (general sense)
  - medicine
- 5 worst inventions
  - capitalism
  - war
  - cults
  - advertisement
  - credit

### criteria

- changes the way we share ideas
- changed political systems
- changed economic systems
- facilitate education
- facilitate regulations
- improve human conditions

- wheel
- energy

### Wood

- used for everything
  - heating
  - smelting
  - energy
- gated by natural resource
- moved to coal
  - less gated at the beginning

### Coal

- 200 tons every 3/4 seconds
- mostly power generation
- moved to oil

### Oil

- 230 barrels per second
  - on top of coal
- more energy per pound

### The Environmental Movement

- 1962: Silent Spring
  - brought environmental issues to the general
  - Highlight connection to nature, rather than a dominance over nature
  - timeline of innovation (chemical) relative to natural time
- 1984: Union Carbide
  - manufacture pesticide "Sevin"
  - MIC (methyl isocyanate) leaked into water system
    - affected half a million people
  - Responsible Care (1985)
    - over 50 countries
  - REACH (2001, adopted 2006)
- 1987: multiple things
  - Montreal Protocol
    - ban of cfc
  - start of sustainable development
    - "Sustainable development seeks to meet the needs and aspirations of the present without compromising the ability to meet those of the future..."
- 1997: Kyoto Protocol
  - commitment to reduce greenhouse gas
  - overall reduction of 5%
  - different for different juristrictions
    - canada was 6%

#### Canada

- 2014, we consumed the last tonne of coal for power generation in Canada
  - over 11 years of effort
  - the reduction of coal powered energy is equal to 42 days in China

#### Circular Economy

- how to change system from **take make waste** to
  - circular systems
- Sustainability goals

## Lecture 2

### Pillars of Sustainability

- Economy, Environment, Society
- looking at environment and economy elements and not social elements this week
  - social policy is connected to welfare state
    - "a social system based on the assumption by a political stae of primary responsibility for the individual and social welfare of its citizen"
  - social policy tends to be a reflection of political ideology or constitutional rights
  - social policies can be related to
    - Health Care
    - Education
    - Senior Security
    - Employment
- Environmental Policies tend to be restriction based
  - tries to protect environment from man-made, corportaion
- Economic Policies tend to be incentive based
  - tries to grow economy with regards to sustainability

#### Environmental Policy (Canada)

- Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)
- Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA)
- among others

#### Environmental Policy (Ontario)

- Some are historic
- Environmental Protection Act (EPA)
  - corporation require permits in order to pollute
  - air, water, soil, etc
  - restriction based
- Ontario Water Resources Act
- Safe Drinking Water Act
- Clean Water Act
- Toxics Reduction Act
- Environmental Assessment Act
  - different projects may need Federal or Provincial Assessment
- etc.

#### Economics: quick overview

- Productivity & Specialization
  - maximize benefits with available resources
    - Canada is big on mining
    - natural resource company
  - tradeoff on moving economy one direction or another
    - which economic sector to invest into
    - represented by political leaders
  - specialization allow economy to focus one area to maximize benefit
    - become expert at provincial/national level at an area
    - Hamilton is an expert in steel
  - spinoff jobs associated with economic sector
    - steel related jobs
      - consultants
      - researchers
      - etc.
- Supply and Demand
  - if demand increase and supply doesn't price goes up
  - if supply increase and demand doesn't price goes down
  - try to achieve equilibrium
  - **Movement**
    - along curve
      **Shifts**
    - change the equilibrium
- **Elasticity**
  - elastic products is very price sensitive
    - price change will significant change in demand
  - inelastic product is not price sensitive
    - demand doesn't really change regardless of price
  - what influences
    - substitues
    - buying power
    - utility?
      - precieved usefulness
- Marketing, Utility and Competition
  - want vs need
  - goal as individuals is to be happy
    - want to consume products that make us happy
    - pick the product that give most happiness
      - how green the object is, fair wages, minority representation
      - etc.
  - Competition
    - consumers can pick between different companies
    - substitutes can enter sector, with a reasonable threshold to leverage consumers
- Economics with Policy
  - control
  - incentives
  - punish
    - sanctions
  - capturing the value of objects where companies bottom line isn't affected
    - value of carbon waste
    - value of environmental damage as a by product of company
  - role of government is to control the areas where the market might fail

#### Ecological Services (aren't we missing something)

- externalities
- what does the Earth do to maintain survival of its inhabitants
- regulate temperature
- clean air
- clean water
- breaks down waste
- provides shelter
- etc
- worth \$33 trillion/year (1997)
  - ~\$4500/inhabitant (not accounting for inflation)
- GDP/capita (2018) ~\$11 700
  - roughly a third of gdp not captured

## Lecture 3

- Natural capitalism
  - Radical Resource Productivity
    - maximize the use of all our resource
    - be hyper efficient with resources
  - Biomimicry
    - use nature as a guide and find systems that are whole
    - closed loop systems and apply it to our world
    - flora fauna cycles
    - eliminate waste in general
  - Services and Flow Economy
    - Think about the services our products provides
    - not everyone needs vehicles, but everyone needs to move from a to b
  - Investing in Natural Capital
    - Similar to Biomimicry

### Environmental Burden

- EB=P\*T\*A
- P: Population
- T: Technology
  - some argue that technology may help with environmental burden
- A: Affluance
  - amount of consumption
  - wealth
  - habits

### Industrial Ecology

- reducting impact on an industrial scale
- one industry's waste is the raw resource of another
- link industrial design and processes to surrounding environment
- link economic system to the environment
  - optimize resources, energy, capital
- redesign industrial systems to mimic ecological systems

#### Cradle to Cradle

- two cycles
  - biological
  - technical
- we don't interrupt biological cycle too much
- what we do take out, we keep the product in a technical cycle
  - recycling the product

#### Down-cycling vs UpCycling

- **Down-cycling**
  - Natural material is used for industrial process and transformed
  - transformed process is recycled for less use
    - economically and technically
  - material eventually can't be recycles and disposed
- **Up-cycling**
  - Natural material is used for industrial process and transformed
  - transformed process is recycled for more use
    - economically and technically
  - Material/process has societal, environmental and economic benefit

#### Industrial Parks

- a bunch of exchanges between industries near each other
  - by-products of industries are up-cycled into a new product in another industry
- Sweden needs waste as they burn waste for energy/heat

#### Policy Consideration (economic drivers)

- charging companies for emissions (tax)
- rewarding companies for dealing with emissions internally
- the reward companies recieve must be bigger than the tax they pay for emissions

#### Sustainable Design

- Focus is beyond environment - incorporation of social impact and community health
- **Opposing arguments**
  - Decouple Environment from Economy
  - Decouple Environment from Social Issues
    - just solve the problem of environment
    - ignore other issues
